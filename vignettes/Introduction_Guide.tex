\section{Introduction}
The \R package \verb@micromap@ is used to create linked micromaps, which display statistical summaries associated with areal units, or polygons. Linked micromaps provide a means to simultaneously summarize and display both statistical and geographic distributions by linking statistical summaries to a series of small maps. The package contains functions, heavily dependent on the utilities of the \verb@ggplot2@ package, which may be used to produce a row-oriented graph composed of different panels, or columns, of information. These panels at a minimum contain maps, a legend, and statistical summaries.

The key to using these functions is to have your data set up correctly. For a first example, we would like to display US state names, a graph illustrating their poverty level, a graph illustrating their percentage of college graduates, and a micromap indicating which states are being referenced. In order to do this, all we need is a table with state names and estimates of each of the two metrics we're interested in. The dataset \verb@edpov@ included in the \verb@micromap@ library is in this form:
